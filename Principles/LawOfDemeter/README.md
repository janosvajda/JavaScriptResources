# Law of Demeter

The Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of loose coupling. The guideline was proposed by Ian Holland at Northeastern University towards the end of 1987,[1] and can be succinctly summarized in each of the following ways:[2]

1. Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
1. Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
1. Only talk to your immediate friends.
