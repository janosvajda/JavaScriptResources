# SOLID

In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

**S**ingle-responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

**O**penâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

**L**iskov substitution principle
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

**I**nterface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

**D**ependency inversion principle
One should "depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
